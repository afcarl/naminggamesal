#Naming Games library in Python, for testing Active Learning strategies.

To test this, especially the provided explanatory notebooks, you can use SageMathCloud, as described here:

* Go to [SageMathCloud][1]
* Sign in, or create an account (<1min)
* Create a new project
* Enter the project
* in the *Terminal command* in the upper right corner, type 
'*git clone https://github.com/flowersteam/naminggamesal.git*'
* When the clone is finished (few seconds), enter the directory *naminggamesal*, and then the *notebooks* one
* Launch the notebooks (normal order is indicated by the numbers at the beginning of the .ipynb filename)

Note: If a module is missing (and you're notified by Jupyter), you can add it via the terminal command '*pip install --user *MODULE'
